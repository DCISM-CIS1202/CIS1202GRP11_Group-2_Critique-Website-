                            <b>Semantics</b> is a useful tool for websites when defining specific areas. 
                            An example is using <b>&lt;nav&gt;</b> to define the navigation bar and the <b>&lt;footer&gt;</b> 
                            to define the <b>&lt;footer&gt;</b> of a web page. The website does not contain 
                            semantic HTML elements and instead defines them into a class 
                            through div. An example of this is the navigation bar for the website. 
                            It does not use the <b>&lt;nav&gt;</b> semantics but uses the <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> tags and uses unordered
                             list <b>&lt;ul&gt;</b> tags for the buttons as displayed in <b>Figure 1:</b>

                        To code properly is to make it as efficient as possible while still remaining readable 
                        for any user who may want to see the process and logic behind the code. 
                        To create a website is to have the codes <b>well organized</b> and<b> readable</b>. 
                        The HTML code for ISMIS is <b>fairly readable</b> for users who may want to 
                        check the code through the inspect element.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A simple way to make code readable is through the use of <b>comments</b>. 
                        In the homepage 
                        for ISMIS, the header section <b>contains comments</b> that guide the user through 
                        how the code works as shown as well as locating certain areas in the HTML code 
                        here in Figure 2:

                        The website <b>does</b> not frequently use nests for their texts. 
                        However, the indentation in the code lacks consistency. 
                        Some areas as seen in <b>Figure 3</b> are properly indented, 
                        however the Terms and Conditions area for ISMIS which contains
                         multiple <b>&lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, and &lt;p&gt; </b>tags,
                         there is a lack of indentation which may prove challenging for some users to read.

                        University portals must depict a <b>centralized 
                        and coherent layout</b> in adherence to the branding and
                         identity it carries all throughout the website navigation. 
                         A centralized layout provides greater <b>accessibility and usability</b>
                         features for students catering to diverse backgrounds regardless of 
                         technical expertise in website navigation in consideration of technological gaps. 
                         This also improves how visually appealing and consistent the preview of the site is. 

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        With the centralized theme of the branding revolving around academic or university portals,
                         the USC layout emphasizes a <b>minimalistic preview</b> showing the relevant announcements 
                         from the faculty and university  and necessary information displayed on the homepage.
                          From a user’s point of view, the simplicity of the website makes it visually appealing,
                           consistent, and intuitive. Attached herein is the layout of the homepage displaying all 
                           the necessary notifications students must keep posted with <b>Figure 5</b>:
                      </p>
                      <br>

                      <p>
                        In line to the coherence of the layout, 
                        it would be a major recommendation to sort out 
                        and organize all the announcements instead of the
                         layered static notifications. Moreover, its visual orientation is 
                         improved when the announcement has a dedicated dimension which 
                         does not necessarily occupy the whole screen. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        However contradictory to this are prevailing issues with
                         the fixed positioning of the elements that often causes
                          issues in non-screen-responsive contexts. Fixed elements 
                          such as headers or floating navigation might not behave 
                          well when the layout needs to adjust for print navigation 
                          which nullifies the overall consistency of the layout. 
                          Additionally, there are redundant buttons that implies 
                          confusion to new users navigating through the website. 
                          Specific to this is the drop down buttons displayed on the 
                          navigation bar such as: Privacy Policy Statement, Evaluation, in <b>Figure 6</b>.

                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <h5>Figure 6: ISMIS Navigation Bar Issue: Button Redundancy, Whitespace, and Margins Obstruction</h5>

                            <br>
                            Supplementary to the redundancy is the disorganized preview of the navigation bar when a user tries to navigate in a different screen dimension. It leaves a specific margin leaving some whitespaces from the website unoccupied which can be deemed as a minor obstruction to its visual appeal. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Overall, the visual appeal of the layout is achieved in its coherence however obturated by several issues on its redundancy and inflexible layout. These minor issues affected the overall look on the website’s coherence which should be subject to revisions and improvements therein after evaluation.

                        With the preview depicted on the site, 
                        the <b>fonts</b> used were consistent throughout 
                        the website as it used similar fonts for the
                         login page and the main page for the overall 
                         look of the university portal.

                         However, there is 
                         lack of emphasis on the headings.
                          One feature that must be subject for improvement 
                          and revision is making the headers or texts 
                          displayed in higher font sizes to be <b>bold</b>. 
                          This gives emphasis on the text as it highlights the
                           button or page functions while retaining the <b>subtext</b> as the description.

                            Another issue recognized is the <b>improper capitalization</b>
                            of the first letter of the first word shown on the website 
                            stated as <b>“please select menu”</b> on the same image which subtly 
                            implies <b>inappropriate text depiction</b> especially for an academic 
                            or university portal.

                    <p>
                        Font coherence is essential, but <b>color contrast and combination</b>
                        also play a crucial role in a website's readability and accessibility. 
                        The attached preview highlights poor color choices that impact the layout.
                        Text on a transparent, glass-like background with dark contrast on hover 
                        reduces readability, especially for visually impaired users. 

                        <br><br>
                        Headers lack emphasis, making the text appear stagnant, 
                        while poor spacing and margins affect visual appeal. A simple improvement,
                         such as centering the header, can enhance the layout's effectiveness.

                            A university’s website serves as a crucial hub for students, 
                            faculty, and staff. Recognizing the importance of accessibility
                             and inclusivity, the University of San Carlos has a responsibility
                              to ensure that its website <b>(ISMIS)</b> is accessible to all users, 
                              including those with disabilities. This section aims to evaluate and 
                              analyze the website’s accessibility and its specific areas of concern.

                            <p>
                              When a screen reader comes across <b>null alt text</b>,
                               it will completely skip over the image, without '
                               announcing its presence. If no alt attribute is present, 
                               the screen reader will read the file name for the image instead, 
                               which can be a major distraction to those using screen-reading technology <b>(SiteImprove, 2024)</b>.
                                A specific number of images on ISMIS lack meaningful and appropriate alt text.
                                 Many use generic placeholders like <b>“img-circle”</b> or are <b>entirely devoid of alt attribute</b>s.
                                  This is a critical issue, especially with regards to accessibility, 
                                  since the alt attribute or alt text is essential for screen reader users 
                                  to understand the purpose and content of the images.

                                   screen reader users cannot determine the destination

                            Although the website can be navigated with a keyboard, 
                            it is very limited to how much the user can navigate and
                             interact with the website. Using the different arrow keys
                              such as the Up arrow and the Down arrow can make the website
                               go up or down, respectively. Pressing <b>Shift+Tab</b> can select the
                                different buttons in the website, and pressing Enter can
                                 activate the selected buttons or elements. 
                                 
                                 <br>
                                 <br>
                                 However, it does not allow the user to select any of the dropdown 
                                 menus so the interactive content becomes very limited to just the 
                                 different links or buttons to the other announcement pages.
                                  So if the user wants to select <b>“Student Services”</b> which is a dropdown menu, 
                                  they can not do so with a keyboard alone.

                                 defines how to make Web content more accessible 
                                 to people with disabilities. <b>Accessibility</b> involves a 
                                 wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, 
                                 physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, 
                                 and neurological disabilities (w3.org, 2024).

                                Several elements exhibit insufficient color contrast 
                                between text and background, making them difficult 
                                to read for users with visual impairments. 
                                This can cause eye strain and make it challenging to
                                 distinguish between text and background elements.

                              ISMIS as a website is already pretty solid for its 
                              purpose and use. Its use and purpose is just to 
                              simply show students ways on how to avail for 
                              documents, get books, find information, and
                               notify students of any important announcements.

                               However, there are still some features that need improvement and these are the following:
